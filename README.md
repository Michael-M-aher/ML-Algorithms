## Brief

This project focuses on implementing various machine learning models in Python, covering a range of algorithms for classification and regression tasks. The implemented models include:

- [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/K-Means)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/KNN)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/Linear%20Regression)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression)
- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/Naive%20Bayes)
- [Neural Network](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/Neural%20Network)
- [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/SVM)

## Installation

To use this project, you will need Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After installing Python 3, you also need to install the required packages. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Once you have Python 3 and the required packages installed, you can leverage the machine learning models.

## Usage

The project is organized into multiple modules, each dedicated to a specific machine learning model. You can use these modules to train and evaluate models on your datasets.

Here is an example of how to use the K-Means clustering module to cluster data:

```python
from k_means import KMeans

# Your data preparation code here

# Instantiate the KMeans class
kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Fit the model to your data
kmeans_model.fit(X)

# Get the cluster assignments for each data point
labels = kmeans_model.predict(X)
print(labels)
```
